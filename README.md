# Predictability of language change project
This repository contains the script and 2 datasets for the "Predictability of language change" project. As is already clear from the title, this project tries to answer the question *how predictable is language change?*

## General idea
It is most likely impossible to foresee when and where a particular language change will emerge (Weinreich et al.â€™s 1968 problem of actuation), but the propagation of a language change follows a fairly predictable trajectory. Language change follows an S-cure through time, that is best modelled by the logistisc equation.

## Data & code
Contains 2 datasets to try out the code. The other datasets can be downloaded from Zenodo. C-CLAMP corpus (Piersoul, De Troij & Van de Velde 2021).
